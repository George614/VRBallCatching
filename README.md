# VRBallCatching
This is a repository for the VR Ball Catching Dataset. 10 subjects participated in a VR Ball Catching Experiment,
where the virtual ball disappeared for 500 ms midway through its parabolic trajectory.
The data for each subject is stored into pandas dataframes available through the following link:
